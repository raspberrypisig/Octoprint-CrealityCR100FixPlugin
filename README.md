# Fix for Creailty CR-100 Printers in Octoprint

This Octoprint plugin makes the Creality CR-100 printer functional under Octoprint.

The code fixes the following gcode responses from the printer:

- M105
- M114

The code is inspired by and mostly taken from the popular **Creality 2x temperature reporting fix** octoprint plugin.
